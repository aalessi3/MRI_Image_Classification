Create Validation set and include validation loss and accuracy in training loop
Add dropout to training : See affects on accuracy
Add self attention
  - Use self attention to increase "explainability" of network decisions
  - With prop P remove some fraction of image with largest attention weights and train using these images

Build Vision Transformer to compare the affectiveness of the two network structures *Note : This may be simpler to do in Tensorflow as there are more resources for this library in regards to TF

Try GANS?
